		"key": "01",
		"heading": "Air or Gas Embolism",
		"description": <><p>Air bubbles in the bloodstream, often after trauma, surgery, or invasive procedures, can block blood flow and damage tissues.</p><p><strong>How HBOT Helps:</strong> High pressure shrinks bubbles, improves oxygen delivery to affected organs, and helps restore circulation.</p></>
	},
	{
		"key": "02",
		"heading": "Carbon Monoxide Poisoning (with or without cyanide)",
		"description": <><p>CO binds to hemoglobin, displacing oxygen and starving tissues of oxygen. Symptoms can range from headache to organ failure.</p><p><strong>How HBOT Helps:</strong> HBOT rapidly removes CO from the blood, floods tissues with oxygen, and protects the brain and heart from lasting injury.</p></>
	},
	{
		"key": "03",
		"heading": "Clostridial Myositis & Myonecrosis (Gas Gangrene)",
		"description": <><p>A rapidly spreading, life-threatening infection caused by toxin-producing anaerobic bacteria.</p><p><strong>How HBOT Helps:</strong> HBOT stops bacterial toxin production, boosts antibiotic effectiveness, and oxygenates tissues to help prevent amputation.</p></>
	},
	{
		"key": "04",
		"heading": "Crush Injury / Compartment Syndrome / Acute Traumatic Ischemias",
		"description": <><p>Severe compression or trauma can cut off circulation and oxygen, risking tissue death and loss of limb.</p><p><strong>How HBOT Helps:</strong> By improving oxygen delivery and reducing swelling, HBOT supports tissue survival and healing after trauma.</p></>
	},
	{
		"key": "05",
		"heading": "Decompression Sickness",
		"description": <><p>Nitrogen bubbles form in the blood or tissues after rapid pressure change, causing pain, nerve damage, or worse.</p><p><strong>How HBOT Helps:</strong> HBOT recompresses and shrinks nitrogen bubbles, restores normal circulation, and accelerates gas elimination.</p></>
	},
	{
		"key": "06",
		"heading": "Problem Wound Healing (e.g., Diabetic Foot Ulcers)",
		"description": <><p>Chronic diabetic ulcers often resist standard care due to poor circulation and infection.</p><p><strong>How HBOT Helps:</strong> HBOT delivers high oxygen to poorly perfused tissue, fights infection, reduces swelling, and promotes healing in Wagner Grade III+ ulcers.</p></>
	},
	{
		"key": "07",
		"heading": "Exceptional Blood Loss Anemia",
		"description": <><p>Severe anemia when transfusion isn&#39;t possible can lead to critical oxygen deprivation.</p><p><strong>How HBOT Helps:</strong> HBOT super-oxygenates blood plasma, temporarily replacing the oxygen-carrying function of red blood cells to keep organs alive.</p></>
	},
	{
		"key": "08",
		"heading": "Intracranial Abscess",
		"description": <><p>A serious infection inside the brain, often requiring surgery and antibiotics.</p><p><strong>How HBOT Helps:</strong> HBOT enhances antibiotic effectiveness, improves oxygen delivery to infected tissue, and supports healing after neurosurgery.</p></>
	},
	{
		"key": "09",
		"heading": "Necrotizing Soft Tissue Infections",
		"description": <><p>A rapidly spreading infection that destroys tissue and can be fatal without aggressive treatment.</p><p><strong>How HBOT Helps:</strong> HBOT inhibits anaerobic bacterial growth, supports immune function, and improves surgical outcomes.</p></>
	},
	{
		"key": "10",
		"heading": "Osteomyelitis (Refractory)",
		"description": <><p>A chronic bone infection that doesn&#39;t respond to standard medical or surgical care.</p><p><strong>How HBOT Helps:</strong> HBOT boosts oxygen deep in bone tissue, helping white blood cells and antibiotics work more effectively, supporting bone repair.</p></>
	},
	{
		"key": "11",
		"heading": "Delayed Radiation Injury (Soft Tissue / Bone Necrosis)",
		"description": <><p>Previous radiation can damage bone or soft tissue, causing pain, breakdown, and delayed healing.</p><p><strong>How HBOT Helps:</strong> HBOT stimulates new blood vessel growth and tissue repair in irradiated areas, improving outcomes for conditions like osteoradionecrosis.</p></>
	},
	{
		"key": "12",
		"heading": "Compromised Skin Grafts and Flaps",
		"description": <><p>Grafts or flaps may fail due to poor blood supply or infection.</p><p><strong>How HBOT Helps:</strong> HBOT improves oxygen delivery to marginal tissue, enhances graft survival, and reduces complications.</p></>
	},
	{
		"key": "13",
		"heading": "Thermal Burns",
		"description": <><p>Severe burns can lead to massive inflammation, tissue death, and risk of infection.</p><p><strong>How HBOT Helps:</strong> HBOT reduces swelling, increases oxygen to damaged tissue, and supports faster wound healing and grafting.</p></>
	},
	{
		"key": "14",
		"heading": "Actinomycosis (Refractory)",
		"description": <><p>A rare but persistent infection caused by Actinomyces bacteria, resistant to standard treatments.</p><p><strong>How HBOT Helps:</strong> HBOT improves oxygenation in infected, fibrotic tissue, enhances antibiotic penetration, and supports surgical clearance.</p></>
